# Project Name: r/A/dio Stream Player

## What does this project do?
This extension provides a simple interface to play and stop a radio stream directly from your browser.

## What version is this?
Ask me again when I get paid for this shit.

## Bugs 
* Play/Stop has 1 instance but if you try to click stop it plays another instance only when the .html is up.
* Scrolling the volumer slider bugs out and plays volume very loud at certain occasions.
